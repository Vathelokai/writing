The sun was nearly down when Sarah started walking home.  The shift at the animal shelter had run late.  One of the veterinarians had not shown up as scheduled, so the full time employees were scrambling.  Sarah was expected to walk each of the dogs and change all the cat boxes.  There were no tasks she could come up with for the two snakes that the shelter was holding.

Most of the evening she stood outside by the fence, cleaning up after each dog one by one.  She daydreamed while staring off into the wooded park. Somewhere her mom was working late.  Mom had been picking up exra shifts while Sarah was confined at the shelter.

It seemed like the full time staff had mostly forgotten about her.  When the sun was setting Alberta starteled herself by coming to the back room and nearly tripping on Sarah, who had her face pressed against the snake cage.

"I thought you were gone!"

"I just finished taking out the dogs."

"All of them?"

Sarah didn't bother answering.  She'd pushed Alberta's presence to the edge of her mind.  Or rather, it slid down some hill.  Filed away with other info like which socks she was wearing.

"You need to get home."

Sarah wondered if the snake was bored.  She had watched a video about how snakes lacked object permanence, that they would forget anyone was around if they were wrapped up in a bag.  She considered replacing the front off the cage with a one way mirror.

"Sarah, come on now."  Alberta taped her on the shoulder until she looked up.
