Soundtracks
I'm thinking that characters should have some kind of vibe
	sarah - crystal method "Vegas"
	Rho - Regina Spektor
	Eddie - Soul coughing, portished

Other influences
	Eddie takes a lot of content from Changling Sluah characters.




Character concepts
	little girl with dozens of imaginary friends.  Turns out the friends are real.
	wonderfully helpful guy who rescues lots of creatures.  Turns out he's harvesting their parts for potions and other things.
	someone who flips over tables at least once per story. in first scene, refuses to sit at a table and mutters  "not yet"



There should be some kind of PETA oranization that wants to liberate magical creatures.

The secret dragon hospital under the clinic

The main mentor character should have a Dr. House vibe.

The semi magical railway on the north border of the reserve.

Some sudden event that kills off lots of magical creatures all over.

Want to include native american culture without fucking it up.  Too much god-awful stereotyping going on there.

Using lots of myth and folklore from natives and early european settlers.
